# Fewer Quality Tiers

This mods reduces the amount of quality tiers. By default it only has `normal`, `rare` and `legendary`, but it's fully configurable with which qualities to keep. It automatically adjusts the probabilities to account for the missing step (or at least attempts to) and adjusts technologies too.

This mod is for players who want to play with quality, but do not want to manage 5 different quality tiers.

# Compatibility

This should be compatible with mods mods, except for mods changing or removing quality tiers. It adjusts probabilities dynamically, so should be able to handle mods changing the technology tree, etc.

This mod can safely be added to existing games. The items and entities of the removed qualities will still exist.
